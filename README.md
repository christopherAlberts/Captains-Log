**_Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise..._** 




This is a cool lightwaight daily systems loger. 



## How It Works: ##

The *Log_Script_Library* contains a number of Powershell scripts. Each of these scripts pulls a diffrent piece of information form the system. If you have a cool script that you'd like to log, feel free to add it to this file.
